# ChurnGuard: An End-to-End MLOps Pipeline for Customer Churn Prediction

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains a churn model training pipeline with **MLflow** experiment tracking and Docker support. The focus is on training multiple classifiers, logging metrics and artifacts, and keeping the results easy to compare across runs.

The goal is to provide a simple, reproducible workflow that takes the prepared churn dataset, trains models, and records the results in MLflow.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

| Layer | Tool |
|---|---|
| **Language** | Python 3.9+ |
| **Experiment Tracking** | [MLflow](https://mlflow.org/) |
| **Containerization** | Docker, Docker Compose & Kubernetes |
| **Modeling** | scikit-learn, XGBoost |
| **CI/CD & Testing** | GitHub Actions, Pytest |

## 🏗 Project Architecture

The project follows a compact training pipeline structure.

```
Raw Data ──► Ingestion ──► Preprocessing ──► Training ──► MLflow Tracking
               (pandas)         (scikit-learn)    (MLflow)
```

1. **Data Ingestion** — Reads the raw churn CSV from `data/raw/data.csv` and creates train/test splits.
2. **Preprocessing & Feature Engineering** — Handles encoding, scaling, and target preparation for the churn dataset.
3. **Model Training** — Trains multiple classifiers and logs hyperparameters, metrics, and artifacts to MLflow.
4. **Experiment Tracking** — Compare runs in the MLflow UI without changing the training code.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Data & Model Versioning
Model artifacts are saved under `models/`, and MLflow keeps a run history in `mlflow/mlflow.db`.

### 2. Automated Experiment Tracking
Every training run is logged via **MLflow**. Compare different algorithms and hyperparameter configurations through the MLflow UI at `http://localhost:5000`.

### 3. Containerized Execution & MLOps Orchestration
The training job and MLflow UI can be run locally with Docker Compose, or scaled dynamically using **Kubernetes** for Enterprise-grade High Availability and Rolling Updates. We enforce Continuous Integration via **GitHub Actions** and Pytest.

## ⚙️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- Docker & Docker Compose
- **Kubernetes** (e.g., Docker Desktop Kubernetes or Minikube - optional for enterprise deployment)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YN2TB/MLOps-Churn-Prediction.git
   cd MLOps-Churn-Prediction
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Training Job

Run the training pipeline locally:

```bash
python main.py
```

Or run the training job and MLflow UI together:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

To run training, MLflow, and the Streamlit prediction UI together:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Then open:

- MLflow UI: `http://localhost:5000`
- Streamlit app: `http://localhost:8501`

### Inspecting MLflow

| Service | URL |
|---|---|
| MLflow UI | `http://localhost:5000` |

The training job writes MLflow metadata to `./mlflow/mlflow.db` and artifacts to `./mlflow/artifacts`.

### Streamlit Prediction With MLflow-Tracked Models

The Streamlit app now supports two inference sources:

- `Local models folder`: loads `models/<model_name>.pkl` and `models/preprocessor.pkl`
- `MLflow runs`: loads both model and preprocessor from the selected run (`runs:/<run_id>/model` and `runs:/<run_id>/preprocessing/preprocessor.pkl`)

For older runs that were logged before this change, the app automatically falls back to `models/preprocessor.pkl` if the run does not contain `preprocessing/preprocessor.pkl`.

Run the UI:

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

In the app, choose **Model Source** and then pick either a local model or an MLflow run.

### Running Tests & CI/CD Pipeline

The project guarantees integration testing via **GitHub Actions** workflows. Ensure testing dependencies are installed and test your components locally before deploying:

```bash
pytest tests/
```

### Enterprise Kubernetes Deployment (K8s)

For a highly available production setup with Load Balancing, deploy the system using Kubernetes:

1. **Build Local Docker Image:**
   ```bash
   docker build -t mlops-churn-prediction:latest .
   ```

2. **Apply Kubernetes Manifests:**
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f kubernetes/
   ```

3. **Access the Microservices:**
   - **Streamlit Inference Web UI:** `http://localhost:8501` (LoadBalanced, Auto-Scaled)
   - **Internal MLflow Tracking:** Port-forward the internal database by running:
     ```bash
     kubectl port-forward svc/mlflow-service 5000:5000
     ```
     then interact via `http://localhost:5000`

*(To cleanly teardown the K8s cluster: `kubectl delete -f kubernetes/`)*

## 🧪 Experiment Tracking

Training runs are tracked automatically. To compare experiments:

1. Start the MLflow UI: `mlflow ui --backend-store-uri sqlite:///./mlflow/mlflow.db --default-artifact-root ./mlflow/artifacts`
2. Open `http://localhost:5000`
3. Navigate to the **churn-prediction** experiment to compare runs

If you hit a migration error (for example missing Alembic revision), run:

`mlflow db upgrade sqlite:///./mlflow/mlflow.db`

To change the model or hyperparameters, edit the values in `src/config.py` and rerun `python main.py`.
